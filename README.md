# Learning Materials

This repo focuses on learning materials for AI agent develoment collected from the internet.

## Communities

Those are communitis that can accelerate your learning.

1. [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) - a community providing opensource models, datasets and APIs to build AI applications.

## Frameworks

Widely used frameworks in AI application development industry.

1. [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) - a widely used frameworks for building AI agents, encapsulating/integrating with almost all the LLMs and third-party frameworks such as embeddings, vectorstores and tools etc..
2. [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai) - LlamaIndex provides a complete set of tools for preparing and querying data for LLMs, including RAG.
